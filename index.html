            <h1>birth</h1>
            <p>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki. He was named after the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather. The Third Hokage made special arrangements for Minato to preserve Kushina's seal containing the Nine-Tails while she gave birth to Naruto in a remote location, escorted by midwives and Anbu. A masked man, Tobi, tracked down their location, however, killed the midwives and Anbu, and captured Naruto, forcing Minato to quickly rescue him and teleport him to a safe house.</p>

            <h1>riseup</h1>
            <p>Naruto is characterised as boisterous, exuberant, and unorthodox, quite similar to Hashirama Senju. He inherited his mother's verbal tic, as he ends his sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) when excited or frustrated. Though he responds best to competition and is not afraid to ask for assistance, Naruto is relatively naive, simple, and slow to understand principles or situations. He often requires an oversimplified analogy in order to grasp explanations, and can even forget some concepts that he himself noted earlier if he is too emotional. Naruto is aware of his faults and admits he acts strong to mask his embarrassment and frustration about them. Despite his naivety, Naruto can be quite observant, picking up on things others miss and retaining information casually gathered through conversation.

                Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social isolation by Konoha's villagers has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: he is heedless to formality and social standings, addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics; he has picky eating habits of ramen, his favurite food; he has a perverted side that manifests as uses of the Sexy Technique or attempts to peep into women's baths; he didn't understand the real meaning of "love" and believes that loving and/or being loved by someone and ramen are both the same. Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that could change a person's world view. He is thus able to build meaningful relationships that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred. Naruto deeply cherishes these bonds and will go to great lengths to protect them, best seen with Sasuke after his defection from Konoha. Naruto's time at the Falls of Truth revealed that a part of him hated the villagers for ostracising him, only to admire him after he saved them during Pain's Assault. This allowed Kurama to manipulate Naruto's rage until he confronted it and learned to let it go, becoming greater than what he suffered.
                
                Another of Naruto's prominent traits is his desire for acknowledgement; his pranks around the village were for people to notice, or at least scol, him. Therefore, he dreamed of one day becoming Konoha's Hokage, the epitome of acknowledement and respect from everyone in the village. Knowing his dream is a long, arduous, and seemingly impossible path, Naruto developed his own nindō of never going back on his word. This life-long philosophy serves as the cornerstone of Naruto's great self-confidence; he believes he can accomplish any goal with enough hard work and perseverance, no matter how big the obstacle is or how long it takes to complete it. This guides him in many aspects of life besides a battle, such as his promise to Sakura of bringing Sasuke back to Konoha. Over time, his goal to be Hokage grew from a desire for acknowledgement to a desire to help and protect the people close to him, which Tobi attributed to the Will of Fire. His nindō is reinforced by his understanding that shinobi were meant to endure through hardships. His belief in hard work and perseverance made him detest people who would use insincere shortcuts to achieve their goals, as he disqualified his son from the Chūnin Exams for using the banned and unfair Kote, and expressed disgust at Momoshiki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki for their reliance on harvesting from Chakra Fruits to lazily gain power.</p>

            <h1>hokage</h1>
            <p>It's the morning of Naruto's Hokage inauguration, but he is still asleep. Hinata asks Boruto and Himawari to go wake him, and when Himawari's "cutesy" way fails, Boruto jumps on him. At the breakfast table, Hinata says she will go pick up his cloak before the ceremony in case it's not finished. Naruto remembers when Kakashi's cloak was not finished in time. Hinata instructs Naruto to go to the venue with the kids quickly while she picks up the cloak.

                Upon arriving and finding that Naruto has not arrived, Hinata rushes home. Naruto is ready to go but Boruto and Himawari fight over a stuffed panda that Himawari wants to bring with her but Boruto says it will embarrass him in front of the villagers. As they have a tug-of-war over it, the panda rips in half. Angry, Himawari awakens the Byakugan and attacks a terrified Boruto. Confused and alarmed, Naruto tries to stop the fight by saying they needed to stop it but is struck by Himawari's finger in the abdomen, and even causes Kurama to react painfully, and knocks Naruto unconscious.
                
                At the ceremony, Sarada is in the audience with her mother and friends, and meets with Chōchō, who hopes the event will be over soon. Sarada silently wonders what's taking the Hokage so long to appear. Kakashi tells Shikamaru that they can't wait any longer and decide to have Konohamaru impersonate as Naruto. As the inauguration begins, Sakura voices her pride for Naruto achieving his dream while Iruka says Naruto will be facing some hard times ahead. At the Uzumaki residence, Hinata finds Naruto unconscious due to all of his chakra points being hit, which will leave him out cold for the rest of the day, and wonders who could have done such a thing. Boruto is hiding in a closet from his sister, who enters the room with a homicidal look in her eyes and asking if he is playing hide-and-seek with her. When it seems that Himawari has found him, Boruto lets out a fearful scream.</p>
